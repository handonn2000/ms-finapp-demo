Description:
This project is implemented to practice the concept of microservice, cloud-native related tools.

## Progress:
- [x] Set up the code base
- [x] Implement account services
- [x] Implement loan services
- [x] Implement card services
- [x] Set up Configuration Central
- [x] Set up OpenFeign for service communication
- [x] Set up Spring Cloud GateWay (routing, tracing & logging)
- [ ] Improve application resilience (circuit breaker, retry, ratelimiter, ...)
- [ ] Set up monitoring tools (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus)
- [ ] Set up keycloak security for applications
- [ ] Apply event-driven architecture (rabbitmq, kafka, spring cloud stream, ...)
- [ ] Set up kubernetes Orchastrator
- [ ] Set up Helm
- [ ] Deployment and CI&CD on GG cloud 
- [ ] Documenting and finalizing README file

## The tech stack:
- Language and tools: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Java 17, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Maven, OpenAPI
- Security: Oauth2, Keycloak (OpenID)
- Deployment and Discovery: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm chart, Eureka, Google Cloud
- Monitoring: Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, Open Telemetry

## Design System:
//TODO: diagram and image of the overall architecture

## DB Schema:
//TODO: ERD diagram

## Services:
- account-service
- loan-service
- card-service

## How to run locally:
